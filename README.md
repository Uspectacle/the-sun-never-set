# ☀️ The Sun Never Set

“The sun never set on the British Empire,” right?
Yeah, never trust those bloody Brits.
Looks like we’ll have to fact-check that one ourselves.
And while we’re at it, let’s have a peek at the other empires.
I hear France is still hanging on to a few “totally-not-colonies” of its own.
